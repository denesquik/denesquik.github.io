            <p>
                What does it take to learn English successfully? There some common qualities such as diligence 
                and a positive attitude that will help you learn any subject, however when learning a language, 
                there are some more specific tips that will help you reach your goals. Here are our ten secrets 
                to success to help you reach your goals in English.
            </p>
            <h4>Break it down then build it up</4>
            <p>
                To speak English well, you need to be able to do several things at the same time: know (and choose) 
                suitable vocabulary, use the right grammar and sentence patterns, and produce the correct sounds, 
                stress patterns, rhythm and intonation. Work on these individual elements separately then practise 
                putting them together to make your speech more accurate and fluent.
            </p>
            <h4>Learn to interact</h4>
            <p>
                A conversation is an interaction with another person, and involves listening as well as talking. 
                Check that the other person is following, by using conversation strategies like emphasizing key words, 
                rephrasing, or using expressions like ‘You know what I mean?’ or ‘Don’t you agree?’ Give the other 
                person a chance to speak and use their answers and to help you think about what to say next.
            </p>
            <h4>Sing a song!</h4>
            <p> 
                Music is a great way to improve your speaking skills, practice the rhythm of the language and learn 
                some useful expressions. Look up the lyrics (song words) to your favorite English songs on the Internet, 
                and then practicing singing aloud. If you’re shy, sing at home alone. If you’re more outgoing, get 
                together with some friends and do a bit of English karaoke.
            </p>
            <h4>Be brave</h4>
            <p>
                You need the right attitude to improve your English. Look for every opportunity to practice speaking, 
                like talking to people at parties, approaching a foreigner who looks lost, or just putting up your hand 
                when your teacher asks a question. Remember, every mistake is an opportunity to learn, so don’t be 
                afraid of making some slips from time to time.
            </p>
            <h4>Think in English</h4>
            <p>
                This is a great way to improve your spoken English, and you can do it anywhere, anytime. At home, you can 
                talk to yourself while doing everyday tasks like preparing a meal. If you are on the train or bus, then 
                describe the people around you (in your head, not aloud!), and when you go to sleep, go over the day’s 
                events in English.
            </p>
            <h4>Record yourself speaking</h4>
            <p>
                Even though you might not like hearing your own voice, this is a very useful way to find out what’s wrong 
                with your spoken English. Record yourself speaking and then listen to the tape, or ask a native speaker 
                for some advice. Look for positive things, too. Make a note of all the things you do well when you speak 
                English. If you are ever feeling unmotivated, look at the things you do well to feel great about speaking 
                English again.
